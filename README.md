## Launch the project

Before you run the project for the first time, you will need to initialise the server settings. Run the following command from the terminal:

```shell
$ make init 
```

Once initialised, run the following command from the terminal to build and run the project:

```shell

## Development

Before you start developing the project, you will need to make sure you are using the correct version of Node and the Node Package Manager (npm). You can do this easily using the Node Version Manager (nvm).

```shell
$ nvm install
$ nvm use
```

You can then launch the project using the Next.js development server, which enables hot reloading and file watching so that you can make changes to the project and it will be automatically reloaded. 

```shell
$ npm run dev 
```
